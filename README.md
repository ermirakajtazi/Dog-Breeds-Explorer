## Typescript - Optional Feature

In this project, I've chosen to incorporate TypeScript as an optional but highly beneficial feature. By leveraging TypeScript, I'm enhancing the development process by introducing static typing to JavaScript, which helps catch errors early on and provides clearer documentation within the codebase. TypeScript improves code readability and maintainability, making it easier for developers to understand and collaborate on the project. Additionally, TypeScript's integration with code editors like Visual Studio Code enhances the development experience by offering features such as code completion and type checking. Overall, while TypeScript is not strictly required, its adoption brings significant advantages in terms of code quality, developer productivity, and application robustness.
